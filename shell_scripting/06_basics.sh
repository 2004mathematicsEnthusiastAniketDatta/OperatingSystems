<<COMMENT 
the  code checks whether a give number is prime or not, if the given number is prime ,the number should have two factors 1 and the same number .
2 has two factors 1 and 2, hence 2 is prime , where as 1 has only one factor 1 hence 1 is not prime. Similarly , 3 ,5,7,11,.... are prime numbers.
Coprime numbers are numbers that are not prime. Not all numbers that are not prime have to be coprime. For loops and functions at a basic level are being 
discussed. 
3. is_prime() {

This defines a new function called is_prime.
In Bash, functions are declared using the function keyword (optional) followed by the function name and an opening brace {.
4. if [ $1 -le 1 ]; then

This line checks if the first argument passed to the is_prime function (represented by $1) is less than or equal to 1. Here's a breakdown:


    [ is a synonym for the test command, which evaluates an expression and returns a truth value (0 or 1).

    $1 refers to the first command-line argument passed to the function.

    -le is an operator that checks if the value on the left is less than or equal to the value on the right.

    1 is the value being compared against.

    ] closes the test command.

    then specifies the action to take if the expression is true.


If the expression is true, the function will return 1 (indicating that the number is not prime).

5. return 1

If the previous condition is true, the function returns an exit status of 1, indicating that the number is not prime.

6. fi

This closes the if statement. It's short for "end if".

7. for ((i=2; i*i<=$1; i++)); do

This line starts a for loop that iterates from 2 to the square root of the input number ($1). Here's what's happening:


    for is the loop keyword.

    (( is the start of an arithmetic expansion (similar to let or expr).

    i=2 initializes the loop variable i to 2.

    i*i<=$1 is the loop condition: as long as the square of i is less than or equal to the input number, the loop continues.

    i++ increments i by 1 on each iteration.

    )) closes the arithmetic expansion.

    do specifies the action to take on each iteration.


The loop will check each number from 2 to the square root of the input number to see if it divides the input number evenly.

8. if [ $(( $1 % i )) -eq 0 ]; then

This line checks if the current number i divides the input number ($1) evenly. Here's what's happening:


    [ is a synonym for test, just like before.

    $(( $1 % i )) computes the remainder of the input number divided by i. The $(( )) syntax is an arithmetic expansion, which allows us to perform arithmetic operations.

    -eq 0 checks if the remainder is equal to 0.

    then specifies the action to take if the expression is true.


If the remainder is 0, it means that i divides the input number evenly, so the function will return 1 (indicating that the number is not prime).

9. return 1

If the previous condition is true, the function returns an exit status of 1, indicating that the number is not prime.

10. fi

This closes the if statement.

11. done

This closes the for loop.

12. return 0

If the loop completes without finding any divisors, the function returns an exit status of 0, indicating that the number is prime.

13. echo "Enter a number: "

This prints a prompt to the user, asking them to enter a number.

14. read num

This reads a line of input from the user and stores it in the variable num.

15. if is_prime $num; then

This line calls the is_prime function with the input number as an argument, and checks the exit status of the function using an if statement.


    is_prime $num calls the function with the input number as an argument.

    if checks the exit status of the function (0 or 1).


If the exit status is 0 (indicating that the number is prime), the code inside the if statement will execute.

16. echo "$num is a prime number"

This prints a message to the user indicating that the input number is prime.

17. else

This specifies an alternative action to take if the exit status of the is_prime function is 1 (indicating that the number is not prime).

18. echo "$num is not a prime number"

This prints a message to the user indicating that the input number is not prime.

19. fi

This closes the if statement.
